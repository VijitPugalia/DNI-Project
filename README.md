# D.O.M.E - Digital Operation for Modular Ecosystems

## Overview
In a future where Earth is overcrowded, humans have relocated to the Moon, building giant glass domes that recreate Earth's environment — sunlight, rain, plants, and birdsong. Inside the DOME, a Moderator controls environmental conditions through sensors, buttons, voice commands, and computers.

## Prototype Concept
An interactive mini-planet where users can:
- Control weather via **voice commands** and **dome rotation (X-axis)**.
- Experience **audio feedback** based on weather changes.
- View **dynamic LED lighting** to reflect environmental conditions.
- Interact physically — **proximity sensors** increase weather intensity as the user approaches.

## First Prototype Features
- **LED Strip**: Visualizes temperature and time of day.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors (x8)**: Detects proximity to enhance interaction.
- **Speakers**: Plays ambient weather sounds.
- **Microphone**: Accepts voice commands to modify weather.
- **Button**: Simulates an earthquake via a **vibration motor**.
- **Black MDF Enclosure**: Enhances LED visibility.

## Components & Materials
- **Main Structure**: Free (salad bowl, MDF board, moon-printed mat).
- **Electronics**: LED strip (WS2812), microphone, speakers, ultrasonic sensors, large arcade button, vibration motor.
- **Budget**: ~$122.65 AUD (within $150 max).

## Technical Specifications
- **Dome Material**: Transparent glass  
- **Size**: 10m diameter, 5m height  
- **Microcontroller**: AI-powered unit  
- **Power Source**: Solar panels  
- **Display**: Dynamic LED strips  
- **Communication**: Voice and audio feedback  

## Interaction Modes
- **Touch**: Proximity-triggered lighting and vibration feedback.
- **Voice**: Weather control via AI processing.
- **Visual**: LED weather simulations.
